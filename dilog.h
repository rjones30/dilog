// dilog - A header-only C++ diagnostic class for finding the point
//         of divergence between two runs of an application that
//         should produce identical results each time it runs, bug
//         does not.

//
// programmer's notes:
// 1) This class is only intended for diagnostic use once a discrepancy
//    has been found in the output of an application between repeated
//    runs with the same input data. It is not intended to be used in
//    regular producition, or become a permanent part of any application.
// 2) The first time you run your dilog-instrumented application in a
//    given directory, it will write its output file into the cwd. 
//    Running it a second time in the same directory will check the
//    dilog output against the original and produce a runtime exception
//    at the first appearance of differences.
// 3) Assuming the g++ compiler, you must include the -std=c++11 switch.
//
// usage example:
//     #include <dilog.h> 
//     ...
//     dilog::printf("myapp", "sheep %d in herd %s\n", isheep, herd);
//     ...
